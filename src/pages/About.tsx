          Dr. M Mohan Alva set up an Ayurvedic clinic in Moodubidire in 1980 to cater to the basic health needs of the people of his village, primarily addressing issues like snake bites. In 1982, he established Alva‚Äôs Pharmacy to produce essential medicines. Responding to evolving needs, the clinic was upgraded into a full-fledged multi-specialty hospital‚ÄîAlva‚Äôs Health Center‚Äîin 1986. After addressing local healthcare needs, Dr. Alva focused on societal upliftment by creating job opportunities for rural youth through paramedical courses. This led to the birth of Alva‚Äôs Education Foundation (AEF) in 1995, beginning with institutes for Nursing and Physiotherapy, and followed by Nursing and Ayurvedic Medical Colleges in 1996. In 1998, he established Alva‚Äôs P.U. and Degree Colleges to introduce innovative changes in education, integrating national-level exam coaching with NCERT curriculum and fostering the Ekalavya Sports Club. Recognizing the importance of holistic development, Dr. Alva emphasized a 24-hour campus life through hostel systems and coaching for competitive exams such as CET, NEET, JEE, NDA, CLAT, IAS, and more. Alva‚Äôs pioneered educational strategies including bridge courses, crash courses, vacation coaching, and NEET long-term training, yielding exceptional student outcomes‚Äîover 300 students qualify for medical education annually.
